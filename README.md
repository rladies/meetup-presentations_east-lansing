## Who should join?
R-Ladies East Lansing welcomes members of **all R proficiency levels**, whether you are a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. *Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!*

*Anyone and everyone interested in R/Data Science should join our group* and participate/contribute in any way you can, be they learners, teachers, developers or innovators! We encourage women and minority genders to present/lead most sessions, conversations but we have no restrictions whatsoever when it comes to membership, participation, and discussions.
